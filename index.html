            <p class="lead">Version Control is a program that keeps a digital snapshot of a file and all of its changes throughout its life cycle in order to recall specific versions later. In the example on the right, you see one folder with files of different variations below it. This is what version control is and why in the programming space it is so unique and beneficial. It can be used to see earlier code and retrace steps. This is also great for graphic designers such as myself who frequently need to edit a version of their file. It is convenient and a streamlined method of having to save every file. Instead, it records it for you. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control Systems provide one main repository for all of the project files. Version Control is the process of recording digital snapshots of files and version control systems are where they are held.It is great because when working on a team it solves the file sharing problem. Team members can check files out, make changes, then check them back in (or committ them). This type of a VCS was first created as a simple database that kept all the changes to files under revision control. Although great at the time, it does not account for team projects, because of its placement locally which was very limiting. It is important to know the progression of VCS to understand why the state it is currently in is so useful.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Unlike Local VCS, Centralized allows for teams working on projects to collaborate. This helps to finish projects faster because of the capabilities of many people being able to work on something. What the CVS does is provide a single server that contains all the versions of a file, and a number of clients that check out files from that central place. This allows for everyone to always be in the know about what another programmer is doing or help with how to complete their tasks by seeing how another did theirs. Especially in academic settings such as universities where students learn off of seeing real projects. A con with the CVS, similar to the local systems is if a hardrive goes corrupt or if the server goes down then files and projects can no longer be saved or accessed.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Modern day and most popular type of version control system is the distributed system. Here is where options such as Git come into play and why it is revolutionizing the way we program. In DVCS, as opposed to just taking snapshots of a file, it completely mirrors the repository as it is at that point AND its history. In the case that the server goes down or a hard drive goes corrupt their is virtually a backup of everything that has been ever done within that project. This type of version control also allows for work with different groups of people and not just certain ones who have access to the server like in a centralized system.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading"><span style="color: #782F40;font-size:60px" >Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a distributed version control system. It helps to manage project files and is so popular because of its ability to keep track of every change made to a project. In addition to that, it tracks who made the changes, and what changes were made by that person. Because of its tracking ability, you are always able to revert back to a previous version of the file. In relation to this course for student shwo are always learning, mistakes will indoubetedly happen so this is great in the education space. Git has basic commands that allow for simpler programming by creating shortcuts that are already in its system. The Git directory is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project. This is the most important part of Git, and it is what is copied when you clone a repository from another computer. </p>
